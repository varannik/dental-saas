feat(scripts,localstack): implement console scripts and fix localstack crash issues

Implement database/redis console scripts and resolve LocalStack crash loop by
fixing Docker volume mount conflicts and using stable version.

## Issues Resolved

1. **Missing Script Implementations**
   - Database console script was placeholder (not functional)
   - Redis console script was placeholder (not functional)
   - Blocked developers from accessing local services

2. **LocalStack Crash Loop**
   - Container continuously restarting with OSError [Errno 16]
   - Volume mount conflict: /tmp/localstack locked by Docker
   - Python 3.13 compatibility issues with dev version 4.11.2.dev23
   - Prevented AWS service mocking and Terraform testing

3. **Unnecessary AWS Dependencies for Local Development**
   - `make local` attempted to run Terraform unnecessarily
   - Required AWS credentials for local development
   - Failed with AWS authentication errors

## Changes Made

### Script Implementations

**scripts/database/console.sh**
- Implemented PostgreSQL console access (local/staging/production)
- Environment validation with proper error messages
- Container status checking before connection
- Security checks and warnings for production access
- Helpful usage tips (psql commands, exit instructions)

**scripts/redis/console.sh**
- Implemented Redis CLI console access (local/staging/production)
- Environment validation and container checks
- Security warnings for production access
- Redis command tips (PING, KEYS, INFO, etc.)
- Interactive console with helpful guidance

**scripts/local/start.sh**
- Modified to skip Terraform step for local development
- Removed unnecessary LocalStack dependency for basic dev
- Uses hardcoded Docker connection strings
- Faster startup without AWS/Terraform overhead

### LocalStack Configuration Fixes

**infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml**
- Changed image from `localstack:latest` to `localstack:3.8.1` (stable)
- Fixed volume mount path: `/tmp/localstack` → `/var/lib/localstack`
- Resolved Docker volume mount conflict causing crash loop
- Added `:ro` (read-only) flag to Docker socket mount
- Enhanced health check: 30s start_period, 10 retries, 15s interval
- Added stability settings: SKIP_INFRA_DOWNLOADS, LS_LOG
- Maintained PERSISTENCE=1 for data retention across restarts
- Kept all 10 AWS services enabled (S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, etc.)

**infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.macos.yml** (NEW)
- Created macOS-specific override configuration
- Docker socket path optimization for macOS
- Lambda network configuration (bridge mode)
- Optional file for macOS-specific issues

## Technical Details

### LocalStack Crash Root Causes Fixed

1. **Volume Mount Conflict** (Critical)
   - Old: `localstack_data:/tmp/localstack` conflicted with startup cleanup
   - New: `localstack_data:/var/lib/localstack` (standard location)
   - Result: No more "Device or resource busy" errors

2. **Unstable Version** (Critical)
   - Old: `localstack:latest` pulled dev version 4.11.2.dev23
   - New: `localstack:3.8.1` stable production release
   - Result: Python 3.13 compatibility, stable runtime

3. **Health Check Timing** (High)
   - Old: Too aggressive (5 retries, no start period)
   - New: 30s start_period allows proper initialization
   - Result: Container marked healthy after services load

### Console Script Features
- Multi-environment support (local/staging/production)
- Container validation before connection
- Security controls for production access
- User-friendly error messages and tips
- Exit instructions and command examples

### Local Development Workflow
- Terraform optional for daily development
- Direct Docker service access (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO)
- No AWS credentials needed locally
- Connection strings provided by startup script

## Testing Performed

- ✅ LocalStack starts successfully and stays healthy
- ✅ All 10 AWS services available (S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, etc.)
- ✅ LocalStack version 3.8.1 confirmed
- ✅ No crash loop, no restart errors
- ✅ `make local` completes without AWS/Terraform errors
- ✅ `make db-console` connects to PostgreSQL
- ✅ `make redis-console` connects to Redis CLI
- ✅ All Docker services healthy and accessible
- ✅ Data persistence works across LocalStack restarts

## Impact

**Before:**
- ❌ Database/Redis console scripts non-functional
- ❌ LocalStack in infinite crash/restart loop
- ❌ OSError [Errno 16]: Device or resource busy
- ❌ Terraform testing impossible (no LocalStack)
- ❌ `make local` failed with AWS auth errors
- ❌ Required AWS credentials for local dev

**After:**
- ✅ `make db-console` and `make redis-console` fully functional
- ✅ LocalStack stable and healthy (v3.8.1)
- ✅ All AWS services available for testing
- ✅ Terraform can use LocalStack for infrastructure testing
- ✅ `make local` works without AWS credentials
- ✅ Faster local startup
- ✅ Data persists across container restarts

## Available Services

**LocalStack AWS Services (All Enabled):**
```
✅ S3              - Object storage
✅ DynamoDB        - NoSQL database
✅ Lambda          - Serverless functions
✅ API Gateway     - API management
✅ CloudWatch      - Monitoring
✅ IAM             - Access management
✅ Secrets Manager - Secret storage
✅ SNS             - Pub/sub messaging
✅ SQS             - Message queues
✅ STS/KMS/Kinesis - Supporting services
```

**Region:** eu-central-1 (all environments)
**Persistence:** Enabled (data survives restarts)

## Developer Experience

### New Available Commands
```bash
make local          # Start local environment (no AWS needed)
make db-console     # Access PostgreSQL console
make redis-console  # Access Redis CLI
```

### PostgreSQL Console Usage
```bash
make db-console
# \l    - List databases
# \dt   - List tables  
# \q    - Quit
```

### Redis Console Usage
```bash
make redis-console
# PING  - Test connection
# KEYS * - List keys
# exit  - Quit
```

### LocalStack Testing
```bash
# Create S3 bucket
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 s3 mb s3://test --region eu-central-1

# List DynamoDB tables
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 dynamodb list-tables --region eu-central-1

# Use with Terraform
terraform apply -var-file=environments/local.tfvars
```

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes are additive or fixes.

**Improvements:**
- Scripts that were placeholders now fully functional
- LocalStack that was broken now stable and working
- Local development no longer requires AWS credentials
- Faster startup (Terraform optional for local)

## Migration Notes

**For existing developers:**
- LocalStack now works reliably
- New console commands available
- `make local` runs faster
- No AWS credentials needed locally
- Can now test AWS services with LocalStack

**For new developers:**
- Run: `make local` to start environment
- Use: `make db-console` for database access
- Use: `make redis-console` for Redis access
- LocalStack available at http://localhost:4566

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- scripts/database/console.sh (implemented from stub)
- scripts/redis/console.sh (implemented from stub)
- scripts/local/start.sh (skip Terraform for local)
- infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml (fix LocalStack)
