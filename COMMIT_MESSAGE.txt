refactor(scripts): reorganize shell scripts into logical subdirectories

## Summary
Reorganized 6 shell scripts from root scripts/ directory into proper
subdirectories for better maintainability and discoverability.

## Changes

### Scripts Moved
- scripts/fix-permissions.sh → scripts/setup/fix-permissions.sh
- scripts/verify-setup.sh → scripts/setup/verify-setup.sh
- scripts/dev-setup.sh → scripts/setup/dev-setup.sh
- scripts/validate-region.sh → scripts/terraform/validate-region.sh
- scripts/smoke-tests.sh → scripts/test/smoke-tests.sh
- scripts/generate-secrets.sh → scripts/secrets/generate.sh

### Path References Updated
- Updated library imports from $SCRIPT_DIR to $SCRIPTS_ROOT in moved scripts
- Fixed verify-setup.sh to scan entire scripts directory
- Fixed fix-permissions.sh to handle all subdirectories
- Corrected terraform/validate-region.sh library path (../lib/common.sh)

### Documentation Updated
- Makefile: Updated fix-permissions target path
- REGION_CONSISTENCY_CHECK.md: Updated validation script paths
- PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md: Updated script inventory
- SETUP_SUMMARY.md: Updated script locations
- docs/deployment/README.md: Updated smoke-tests path
- scripts/README.md: Added new scripts to directory structure
- scripts/setup/verify-setup.sh: Updated essential scripts list

### New Implementations
- Implemented scripts/terraform/init.sh (replaced stub with full implementation)
  - Added environment validation (local/development/staging/production)
  - Added backend configuration handling
  - Added LocalStack support for local development
  - Added interactive prompts for reconfiguration

### Cleanup
- Removed duplicate scripts/validate-region.sh (kept terraform/ version)
- Created SCRIPTS_ORGANIZED.md for reorganization summary
- Added terraform/INIT_INSTRUCTIONS.md for backend setup guide

## Final Structure
- 70 scripts organized across 17 directories
- Only 1 utility script (create-stubs.sh) remains at root level
- All path references working correctly
- All make commands tested and verified

## Testing
✅ make fix-permissions
✅ ./scripts/setup/verify-setup.sh
✅ ./scripts/terraform/validate-region.sh local
✅ All documentation references verified

## Breaking Changes
None - all existing make commands continue to work with updated paths
