fix(terraform): resolve region mismatch and initialize terraform for eu-central-1

Fix critical region inconsistency between terraform configuration and S3 backend
bucket location. All infrastructure now consistently configured for eu-central-1
region across all environments.

## Issues Resolved

1. **Region Mismatch Error (301)**
   - S3 backend bucket exists in eu-central-1
   - Terraform configs specified us-east-1
   - Caused "requested bucket from us-east-1, actual location eu-central-1" error

2. **Terraform Initialization Failure**
   - Backend configuration prevented successful terraform init
   - Required clean initialization with correct region settings

3. **LocalStack Region Inconsistency**
   - LocalStack defaulted to us-east-1 while configs used eu-central-1
   - Created testing/production environment discrepancies

## Changes Made

### Configuration Updates
- **infrastructure/terraform/environments/local.tfvars**: us-east-1 → eu-central-1
- **infrastructure/terraform/environments/staging.tfvars**: us-east-1 → eu-central-1
- **infrastructure/terraform/environments/production.tfvars**: us-east-1 → eu-central-1
- **infrastructure/terraform/variables.tf**: default region updated to eu-central-1
- **infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml**: LocalStack DEFAULT_REGION → eu-central-1

### Backend Configuration
- **infrastructure/terraform/backend-staging.hcl**: created with eu-central-1 region
- **infrastructure/terraform/backend-production.hcl**: created with eu-central-1 region
- **infrastructure/terraform/main.tf**: updated backend comments to reflect correct region

### Documentation
- **TERRAFORM_REGION_FIX.md**: comprehensive guide explaining the fix
- **LOCAL_DEV_WITHOUT_LOCALSTACK.md**: local development guide without AWS simulation
- **infrastructure/terraform/BACKEND_SETUP.md**: backend configuration documentation
- **REGION_CONSISTENCY_CHECK.md**: removed (outdated, replaced by new docs)
- **SCRIPTS_ORGANIZED.md**: removed (consolidated into other documentation)

## Technical Details

### Region Selection Rationale
- Chose eu-central-1 to match existing S3 backend bucket location
- Avoids costly bucket migration
- Common region for European deployments
- Maintains consistency across all environments

### Backend Strategy
- Local: Uses local state file (no S3 backend required)
- Staging/Production: Uses S3 backend with DynamoDB locking
- Partial backend configuration via .hcl files for environment separation

### Terraform Reinitialization
- Removed .terraform directory with incorrect configuration
- Successfully ran `terraform init` with correct region settings
- Verified with `terraform validate` and `terraform plan`

## Testing Performed

- ✅ Terraform initialization successful
- ✅ Terraform validation passes
- ✅ Terraform plan works for local environment
- ✅ All region references consistent across codebase
- ✅ LocalStack configuration updated (though not required for local dev)
- ✅ PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO running successfully

## Impact

**Before:**
- ❌ Terraform init failed with 301 redirect error
- ❌ Region mismatch prevented backend access
- ❌ Mixed region configurations across environments
- ❌ LocalStack/production environment inconsistencies

**After:**
- ✅ Single region (eu-central-1) across all environments
- ✅ Terraform initialization working
- ✅ Backend configuration properly set up
- ✅ Clear documentation for local development
- ✅ Ready for staging/production deployment

## Migration Notes

**For existing deployments:**
- No migration needed if starting fresh
- Existing resources in us-east-1 would need manual migration
- S3 backend bucket already exists in eu-central-1 (no changes needed)

**For new developers:**
- Run: `docker compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d postgres redis minio`
- LocalStack not required for local development
- See LOCAL_DEV_WITHOUT_LOCALSTACK.md for setup guide

## Breaking Changes

None. This is a configuration fix that aligns with existing infrastructure.
Previous state was non-functional due to region mismatch.

- LOCAL_DEV_WITHOUT_LOCALSTACK.md - Local development guide
- infrastructure/terraform/BACKEND_SETUP.md - Backend configuration guide
- QUICKSTART.md - Quick start guide (unchanged)

## Deprecation Warnings Addressed

Added documentation comments for `dynamodb_table` parameter deprecation
in backend configuration files. Still functional, but noted for future
Terraform 1.9+ migration to `use_lockfile` parameter.
