## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

```bash
# 1. Fix permissions (first time only)
make fix-permissions

# 2. Check dependencies
make check-deps

# 3. View all commands
make help
```

---

## 📋 Available Commands (Working Now)

### ✅ Fully Functional

```bash
make help                # Show all commands
make check-deps          # Check dependencies
make fix-permissions     # Fix script permissions
make install             # Install npm dependencies
make install-tools       # Install dev tools (macOS/Linux)
make deploy-staging      # Deploy to staging (full implementation)
```

### 🔄 Stub Commands (Show Helpful Messages)

All other commands work but show implementation instructions:

```bash
make local               # Start local environment (stub)
make docker-up           # Start Docker containers (stub)
make test                # Run tests (stub)
make build               # Build all (stub)
# ... 50+ more commands
```

Each stub script shows:

- ✅ What it should do
- ✅ Where to implement it
- ✅ Helpful guidance

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option 1: Implement Essential Scripts

Implement these 6 scripts to get a fully functional local environment:

1. **`scripts/docker/start.sh`** - Start Docker containers
2. **`scripts/docker/stop.sh`** - Stop Docker containers
3. **`scripts/terraform/init.sh`** - Initialize Terraform
4. **`scripts/terraform/apply.sh`** - Apply Terraform
5. **`scripts/database/migrate.sh`** - Run migrations
6. **`scripts/dev/start.sh`** - Start dev server

**Time estimate:** 1-2 hours

**Result:** `make local` and `make dev` will be fully functional

---

### Option 2: Use What's Ready

Start using the implemented features now:

```bash
# Check your environment
make check-deps

# Install dependencies
make install

# Deploy to staging (when ready)
make deploy-staging
```

## 🛠️ How to Implement a Stub

### Example: `scripts/docker/start.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/docker/start.sh
# Start Docker containers

set -e

SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/common.sh"
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/docker.sh"

print_header "Starting Docker Containers"

# Check if Docker is running
if ! check_docker_running; then
  die "Docker is not running"
fi

# Start containers
start_containers

# Wait for services
wait_for_postgres
wait_for_redis
wait_for_minio

log_success "All Docker containers started!"
```

Then test:

```bash
make docker-up
```

---

## 🎨 Architecture

```
Makefile (Orchestration)
    ↓ calls
Shell Scripts (Implementation)
    ↓ uses
Shared Libraries (lib/)
    ↓ manages
Infrastructure (Docker/Terraform/AWS)
```

### Design Principles

- ✅ **Modularity** - One script, one purpose
- ✅ **Reusability** - Shared functions in lib/
- ✅ **Conditional** - Check before create
- ✅ **Safety** - Confirmation prompts
- ✅ **Documentation** - Self-documenting

## ✅ What Works Right Now

### Commands You Can Run

```bash
# Help & Info
make help                    # ✅ Works
make check-deps              # ✅ Works

# All other commands work but show:
# "This script is not yet implemented"
# "Here's what it should do..."
# "Edit: scripts/path/to/script.sh"

make local                   # 🔄 Stub
make docker-up               # 🔄 Stub
make test                    # 🔄 Stub
# ... etc
```

## 🔐 Security

### ✅ Protected (Not in Git)

- `.env` files
- `*.secrets.tfvars` files
- `*.tfstate` files
- AWS credentials
- SSH keys
- `node_modules/`

### ✅ In Git (Safe)

- Makefile
- Shell scripts
- Docker Compose
- Terraform configuration
- `.tfvars` files (non-sensitive)
- `.env.example` (template)

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Getting Started

1. Read [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md)
2. Run `make help`
3. Try `make check-deps`
4. Read [status/05-ROADMAP-NEXT-STEPS.md](./status/05-ROADMAP-NEXT-STEPS.md)

### Understanding the Code

1. Read [scripts/README.md](./scripts/README.md)
2. Study [scripts/lib/common.sh](./scripts/lib/common.sh)
3. Look at [scripts/local/start.sh](./scripts/local/start.sh)
4. Review [scripts/deploy/staging.sh](./scripts/deploy/staging.sh)

### Implementing Scripts

1. Check [status/06-STEP-BY-STEP-PHASE0-FOUNDATION-FIX.md](./status/06-STEP-BY-STEP-PHASE0-FOUNDATION-FIX.md) for implementation templates
2. Use existing scripts as examples
3. Test with `make <command>`
4. Iterate and improve

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied

```bash
# Fix:
make fix-permissions
```

### Script Not Found

```bash
# All stub scripts are created
# They just need implementation
# Run the command to see what it should do
make <command>
```

### Docker Not Running

```bash
# macOS: Start Docker Desktop
# Linux: sudo systemctl start docker
```
